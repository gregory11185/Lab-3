# Lab-3

Sorting Folder consists of Python program that reads name and position number for 15 people from the "input.txt" file. It then sorts them out base on the position number and prints them in proper order to file "output.txt" 

I only managed to do about 6 or 7 C# programs from the Eulers website. They seemed much more difficult than I originally anticipated.
SimpleApp didnt seem to open normaly to see the code here or maybe I attached the wrong file so I included the C# in text form also called "C# Programs as Text File"
